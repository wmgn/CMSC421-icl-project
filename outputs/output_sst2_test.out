Second prompt: <s>[INST] <<SYS>>You are a psychologist. You are precise. You analyze sentiment of people's reviews. You respect the analyzation.<</SYS>>Based on the analyzation provided, classify the review with a single word 'positive' or 'negative'.

Here is the review you need to classify with a single word 'positive' or 'negative':
##Review: unflinchingly bleak and desperate 
##Analyzation:  Sure, I can help you with that!

Based on the given review, "unflinchingly bleak and desperate," there are several words that indicate positive and negative attitudes:

Positive Attitudes:

* Unflinchingly: suggests a bold and uncompromising approach to the subject matter.
* Bleak: can be interpreted as a reference to the darkness and despair in the film, but also implies a sense of realism and authenticity.
* Desperate: conveys a sense of urgency and desperation, which can be seen as a positive aspect of the film.

Negative Attitudes:

* Bleak: as mentioned above, can also be seen as a negative connotation, implying a lack of hope or optimism.
* Desperate: can also be interpreted as a negative trait, suggesting a sense of hopelessness or frustration.

After analyzing the words that indicate positive and negative attitudes, I would say that the negative attitudes are stronger in this review. The use of the word "bleak" has a double meaning, both positive and negative, but the overall tone of the review is more negative than positive. The reviewer seems to be implying that the film is overwhelmingly dark and desperate, with little hope or optimism. Therefore, the negative attitudes in the review outweigh the positive ones.
