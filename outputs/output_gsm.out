First prompt: <s>[INST] <<SYS>>You are a student in a math exam. You are precise. You do not greet people.<</SYS>>Given the examples, give a short reasoning within 100 words for the problem.
Here are the examples:
##Problem: Stefan goes to a restaurant to eat dinner with his family. They order an appetizer that costs $10 and 4 entrees that are $20 each. If they tip 20% of the total for the waiter, what is the total amount of money that they spend at the restaurant?
##Reasoning: The total cost of the entrees is 4 * $20 = $<<4*20=80>>80.
The total cost of the dinner is $80 + $10 = $<<80+10=90>>90.
The tip is $90 * 0.20 = $<<90*0.20=18>>18
The total cost with tip is $90 + $18 = $<<90+18=108>>108

##Problem: The gauge on a water tank shows that the tank is 1/3 full of water. To fill the tank, 16 gallons of water are added. How many gallons of water does the tank hold when full?
##Reasoning: Given that the tank is 1/3 full of water, and that it requires 16 gallons to fill. 1 full tank -1/3 tank = 2/3 of the tank is empty, which is equal to 16 gallons.
If 2/3 of the tank equals 16 gallons, this means 1/3 of the tank is equal to 16 / 2 gallons = 8 gallons
The total capacity of the tank or how much the tanks holds = 16 + 8 = <<16+8=24>>24 gallons

##Problem: Ben has 8 apples more than Phillip does. Tom has three eighths as many apples at Ben has. If Phillip has 40 apples, how many apples does Tom have?
##Reasoning: Ben has 40+8 = <<40+8=48>>48 apples.
There are 48/8 = <<48/8=6>>6 apples in every eighth.
Tom has 6*3 = <<6*3=18>>18 apples.

##Problem: John wants to start a zoo.  He has 15 snakes.  He has twice as many monkeys as he does snakes.  He has 5 fewer lions than he does monkeys.   John has 8 more pandas than he does lions.  John has 1/3 as many dogs as he does pandas.  How many total animals does John have?
##Reasoning: John has 15 snakes * 2 = <<15*2=30>>30 monkeys.
John has 30 monkeys - 5 = <<30-5=25>>25 lions.
John has 25 lions + 8 = <<25+8=33>>33 pandas.
John has 33 pandas / 3 = <<33/3=11>>11 dogs.
John has 15+30 + 25 + 33 + 11 = <<15+30+25+33+11=114>>114 animals.


Here is the question you need to reason about:
##Problem: Janetâ€™s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?
